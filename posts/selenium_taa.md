title: '[Selenium] Understanding the Four Layers in Selenium WebDriver Framework'

Conceptually, all QA automation frameworks are structured into four key layers:

1. **Test Generation Layer**
2. **Test Definition Layer**
3. **Test Execution Layer**
4. **Test Adaptation Layer**

These layers govern the interactions between a **Test Automation Solution (TAS)** and the **System Under Test (SUT)**.

### Breakdown of Each Layer

#### 1. Test Generation Layer
This layer focuses on **designing test cases**, either manually or automatically. It answers the question: *What should be tested?*

**Example:** Imagine testing a login function by using various combinations of username and password, then clicking the login button.

In many cases, this layer doesn't interact directly with the automation tool. Instead, external test case management tools (such as Jira) are used to plan and manage test cases.

#### 2. Test Definition Layer
The **Test Definition Layer** is responsible for **defining and implementing the test cases** and test suites. It converts the scenarios from the test generation layer into **executable scripts** using a programming language. This is where automation engineers spend the most time writing code if the automation testing framework doesn't support translating test cases to codes.

**Example:** Defining the steps for "When the user enters valid username and password" by coding the specific WebDriver commands like `driver.findElement()` and `sendKeys()`.

#### 3. Test Execution Layer
The **Test Execution Layer** is responsible for running the actual test scripts. It also handles logging and reporting the test results.

**Example:** In Selenium WebDriver, this layer involves launching a browser (such as Chrome or Firefox), performing actions (like clicking buttons and entering text), and comparing the actual results with the expected ones. It logs whether each test passed or failed and captures additional information like screenshots.

#### 4. Test Adaptation Layer
The **Test Adaptation Layer** provides the necessary code and objects to communicate with the SUTâ€™s user interface, typically via the web browser. This is where **Selenium WebDriver** comes into play, offering APIs to interact with web elements.

This layer isolates the test cases/test suites from the SUT itself, ensuring that the automation framework can work across different environments with minimal changes.
