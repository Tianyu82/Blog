There are two types of testing in software: **Static Testing** and **Dynamic Testing**. The difference is in **whether** the code is executed.

- **Static Testing** is static review of work products such as test plans, codes, and requirements. For example, the QA team discuss the completeness of the product requirements with the product team and the developers. In the code review session, the developers may discuss the coding conventions, which can also be a commom static testing activity.
- **Dynamic Testing** is the defect catching process that requires the test objects to be executed. Black-box testing, white-box testing are both dynamic testing.

Importantly, in most cases, both static testing and dynamic testing can be done in all phases of the SDLC. It is encouraged that the static testing is done as early as possible because static testing can find defects that cannot be uncovered by dynamic testing.
