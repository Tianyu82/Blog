Testing plays a crucial role in software development life cycle. Both manual testing and automation testing have their unique strengths and are better suitable to specific scenarios. In this blog, I will share my understanding of when to use each appraoch.

### When Manual Testing is a Better Approach

#### Small Projects  
Manual testing is ideal for small projects where the labour time required to set up an automation framework doesn't pay off. With manual testing, testers can begin working as soon as the application is ready, avoiding the upfront investment in automation tools and scripting.  

For example, a diagnostic tool built for a specific customer with limited use cases would benefit more from using manual test.  

#### Stable Projects with Minimal Changes  
Projects that have matured and no longer require frequent updates are less necessary to use automation. Since regression testing demands are minimal, manual testing can ensure quality without the need for automation overhead.  

For instance, a standalone mobile application with no planned updates may only require occasional manual checks to confirm its functionality.  

#### Exploratory Testing  
Exploratory testing involves testers dynamically working on the software, using their creativity, intuition, and expertise to find out unexpected issues. This approach is essential when rapid feedback is needed, or when there are no predefined test cases. Since it requires human judgment and adaptability, exploratory testing is more suitable for manual testing.  

For example, if your team needs to quickly assess a new software system without prior documentation, testers can explore the application to learn its behavior and identify bugs by "clicking around" and forming strategies on the fly.  

#### Usability Testing  
Usability testing evaluates the application's ease of use, user-friendliness, and overall experience. Since usability relies on human perception, manual testing is the only effective way to assess how real users interact with the software. Testers use heuristics and subjective judgment to identify issues, for example bad UI designs and difficult workflows. 

For example, during usability testing for a new mobile app, testers might find that a crucial disclaimer is displayed in a small, hard-to-read font, leading to improvements based on their feedback.

### When Automation Testing is a Better Approach  

#### Regression Testing  
Regression testing ensures that existing functionality works as intended after code changes, such as bug fixes or new feature implementations. This type of testing is highly repetitive and needs to be executed frequently during the software development lifecycle.  

Automation testing is ideal for regression testing because once the test scripts are created, they can be run repeatedly at no additional cost. Over time, the initial investment in automation tools, framework setup, and script development yields positive returns.  

For example, a web application that undergoes bi-weekly feature releases benefits from automated regression testing to verify that new updates do not introduce new bugs or break existing features.  

#### Load and Performance Testing  
Load testing is a type of performance testing which involves simulating a large volume of users accessing a system simultaneously to measure its behavior under stress. Automation is essential for such testing because it would be nearly impossible for manual testers to mimic thousands of concurrent users.  

Tools like JMeter, Gatling, or LoadRunner are commonly used to automate these tests. For instance, an e-commerce website anticipating heavy traffic during a Black Friday sale can use automated load testing to ensure that its servers can handle the increased user demand efficiently.  

#### Unit Testing  
Unit testing focuses on validating individual components or units of a software application in isolation. Automated unit tests, often written by developers, are run early and frequently to catch bugs during the development phase. This practice promotes faster feedback and helps maintain the code's quality over time.  

Frameworks like JUnit (Java), Jest(JavaScript/TypeScript) and PyTest (Python) are commonly used for automating unit tests. For example, while developing a REST API, automated unit tests ensure that each endpoint functions correctly before integrating it with other components.  

#### Repetitive and High-Volume Testing Tasks  
Tasks that involve executing the same tests across multiple environments, datasets, or configurations are better suited for automation.  

For instance, cross-browser testing, where a web application needs to be validated across multiple browsers and their versions, can be efficiently automated using tools like Selenium or BrowserStack. This saves time and ensures consistent coverage.

### Conclusion  
Both manual and automation testing have their strengths and are best suited for different scenarios. Manual testing excels in areas requiring human judgment, creativity, and adaptability, automation testing is good at in scenarios involving repetitive, large-scale, or highly technical tasks. A balanced approach that combines both methodologies ensures comprehensive test coverage and high-quality software delivery.
